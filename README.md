## GSAP Animations

The project uses GSAP to create smooth animations and scroll-triggered effects across the site. For example:

These animations add a modern and interactive feel to the overall user experience.

- Simple validation is in place to ensure fields are correctly filled out before submission.
- Upon success, a message confirmation appears, indicating that the message was sent successfully.

## Confetti Effect

- **Confetti.js** is used to trigger a confetti effect when the contact form is successfully submitted.
- The confetti effect adds a celebratory element to the user experience, enhancing feedback upon form submission.

This portfolio is fully responsive, with breakpoints for:

- **Desktop (1200px and above)**
- **Tablet (768px to 1024px)**

Media queries are used in SCSS to adjust layout, font sizes, and element visibility across different devices.
